# Advanced dWebsite Topics

This section covers advanced concepts and techniques for building sophisticated dWebsites and managing complex ENS configurations.

## ⚠️ Technical Review Required

**Important:** The code examples and technical implementation details in this section should be verified with current versions of the respective technologies. While the conceptual framework and workflows are accurate, specific commands, API calls, and configuration details may need updates based on:

- Current IPFS/IPNS versions
- Latest ENS contract addresses
- Updated Arweave SDK
- Current library versions (ethers.js, etc.)

**Recommendation:** Test all code examples in your development environment and verify with official documentation before production use.
