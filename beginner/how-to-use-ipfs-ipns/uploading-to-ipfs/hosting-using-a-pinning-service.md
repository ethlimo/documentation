# Hosting using a pinning service

#### Pinning services <a href="#pinning-services" id="pinning-services"></a>

An easy way to make sure important data is retained is to use a pinning service. These services run lots of IPFS nodes and will _pin_ your data for you! This way, you don't have to run and maintain your own IPFS node. Check out the [Persistence page](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/persistence/) for more information on pinning services.
