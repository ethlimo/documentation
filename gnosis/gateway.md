# .gno Resolution

We now support [`.gno`](https://genomedomains.com/) name resolution at `*.gno.limo`. GNOS domains are ENS compatible and function in the same way as `.eth` dWebsites. Once a `contentHash` record has been defined, users can visit their dWebsite by appending `.limo`. For example: [12345.gno.limo](https://12345.gno.limo).

### Resolution

The resolution process for `.gno` domains is identical to that of `*.eth.limo`. Please consult the main gateway [documentation](../introduction/what-is-eth.limo/gateway-basics/README.md) for more information.
