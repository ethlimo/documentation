# What is IPFS/IPNS?

### IPFS: A New Way to Store and Access Files

IPFS reimagines how we store and access files online, moving away from centralized servers to a distributed network.

* **Content Addressing**: Files are located by what they contain, not where they're stored.
* **Decentralization**: Data is spread out over a network, which means no single point can bring it down.
* **Efficiency**: Resources are shared, making the system faster and less costly.

### IPNS: Naming in the Decentralized Web

While IPFS gives us decentralized storage, IPNS gives us a way to update and find the latest content easily.

* **Persistent Links**: With IPNS, you can update content without changing the link people use to find it.
* **Version Control**: Keep your content current without losing the history of changes.
* **Secured Updates**: Only authorized updates are allowed, so content remains safe.

### The Combined Power of IPFS and IPNS

Together, IPFS and IPNS empower users to take control of their online content, from blogs and websites to applications that need to stay current.

* **Simplified Access**: By using `.eth` domains with eth.limo, accessing decentralized content is as simple as browsing the regular web.
* **Reliable Content Sharing**: Share content knowing it's secure and will always be available.
* **Dynamic Content Management**: Perfect for those who regularly update their content.

### Conclusion

IPNS and IPFS are building blocks for a web where users control their data and can rely on resilient, efficient access to content.&#x20;
